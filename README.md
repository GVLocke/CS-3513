        - intro
            - `App.java` demonstrates the basic functionality of interfaces.
    - overriding
        - `App.java` demonstrates the concept of method overriding by having the different `Bank` child classes override the `fixInterestRate()` function.
    - genericclass
        - `tripleitem/App.java` and `wordcount/App.java` demonstrate the functionality of generic classes.

- leapyear
    - `LeapYear.java` determines whether a given year is a leap year.
- loops
    - `Average.java` finds the average of a list of values
    - `Bidding.java` demonstrates the functionality of a while loop in a simple bidding program.
    - `Interest.java` calculates the compound interest after 10 years for a dollar amount and percentage.
- messingwithfiles
    - `CreateFile.java` demonstrates how to create a file using the `File.createNewFile()` method.
    - `DisplayPicture.java` demonstrates how to display an image file in a `JFrame` window.
    - `FileReadNums.java` demonstrates the functionality of the `FileInputStream` class by reading in data from a file as integers rather than strings.
    - `GetFileInformation.java` demonstrates the different file data methods of the `File` class.
    - `ReadFile.java` demonstrates the ability to read lines from a file using the `Scanner` class.
    - `ReadFromPicture.java` uses a `FileInputString` object to print out each byte of an image file.
    - `WriteToFile.java` demonstrates the basic functionality of the `FileWriter` class.
- palindrome
    - `App.java` determines whether a string is a palindrome.
- salarycalc
    - `App.java` calculates an annual salary from hourly wage, hours per week, and weeks worked per year.
    - `GuiApp.java` does the same thing but uses a GUI instead of a CLI.
- strings
    - `MadLibs.java` is a mad libs program that demonstrates the functionality of string concatenation.
    - `EqualWords.java` is a program that demonstrates the functionality of the substring method.
- swapping
    - `SwapNoTemp.java` swaps two variables without using a temp variable.
    - `SwapWithTemp` swaps two variables using a temp variable.
- swing
    - `EmptyFrame.java` is the most barebones Swing application that simply displays a blank frame.
    - `HistogramViewer.java` displays a simple histogram graph.
    - `SalaryGridGUI.java` introduces the use of a `GridBagLayout`.
    - `SalaryGUI.java` is a simple GUI app that calculates the yearly salary corresponding to an hourly wage.
- tollcalculation
    - `App.java` calculates the toll for a driver based on when they passed the toll booth.
    - `ImprovedApp.java` does the same thing but uses the LocalTime library to simplify the code.
- referencetype
    - `ArrayListTest.java` demonstrates the basic functionality of the ArrayList class.
    - `DecimalToBinary.java` tests out the toBinaryString() method of the Integer wrapper class.
    - `ParsingInts.java` tests the difference between the valueOf() and parseInt() methods of the Integer wrapper class.
